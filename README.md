# Understanding PU Learning Through Implementing Its Algorithms

## Development Environment

- Python 3.9
- Dependencies: See [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml).

## Installation

Use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

```
$ poetry install
```

## About notebooks

Most notebooks are implementation of algorithms proposed for PU learning.

Some notebooks include graphs created by Plotly, but as Github performs a static render of notebooks, they will not be rendered.  A rich view of notebooks can be shown by using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hkiyomaru/pu-learning/tree/main/).
